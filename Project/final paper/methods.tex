\subsection{Background}
- Linear subspace simulation\\



\subsection{Equations of Motion}
Gauss' Principle of Least Constraint \\
Derivation\\

\subsection{Autoencoder}
TODO: Make a figure demonstrating my network architecture.\\


- Learn low dimensional representation using autoencoder.\\
- Training data comes from offline full space simulation.\\
- First and last layer of Autoencoder are initialized with frozen weights computed with PCA. The PCA rank is chosen such that the
full deformation space can be adequately captured.\\
